"","General","MimeKit is an Open Source library for creating and parsing MIME, S/MIME and PGP 
messages on desktop and mobile platforms. It also supports parsing of Unix mbox 
files. Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to pars
e string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams
, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as 
message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than
 other .NET MIME parsers. MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsi
ng the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME par
sers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIM
E parser out there, including the commercial implementations. In addition to hav
ing a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivat
ive of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's l
imitations. API documentation can be found on the web at http://www.mimekit.net/

 is a non-opinionated, broad and deep framework with multiple different ways to 
assert that your code behaves as expected. Many aspects of NUnit can be extended
 to suit your specific purposes. The latest version, version 4, is an upgrade fr
om the groundbreaking NUnit 3 framework. It is a modernized version, aimed at ta
king advantage of the latest .NET features and C# language constructs. If you ar

NUnit 4 Migration Guide (https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/Nun
